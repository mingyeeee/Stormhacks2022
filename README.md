## Problem

Many students arenâ€™t the fastest notetakers and the act of note taking can thus it can make lectures less engaging as the student is distracted from participating in class discussions and active thinking during lectures. Thus students are forced to go back to the lecture notes/recording to gather information that has been missed; creates gaps in the learning of students. Moreover our software can show students how what they are learning is relevant in the "real world" and how they might use it in their future careers. 


## Main features 

Convert professor's speech to text using context assisted audio transcription 

As the professor is teaching whats happening is that we are looking for keywords such as nouns and key technical terms the professor mentions using machine learning. 

These keywords will then be used to perform a search through Wikipedia (web scrape and collect links) 

Create a network of potentially related topics; makes it easier for student to look at certain topics that they aren't familiar with. 

The software will use computer vision, look for things diagrams, equations and some bold ideas and then it will put a timestamp of where it was taken and the picture of the formula  

The program will then create an html page where all the links and notes (diagrams/equations) are displayed.

## How it works

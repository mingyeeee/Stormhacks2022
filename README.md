## Problem

The transition from traditional in-person school to online school as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has been turbulent for many students. Students had to adapt quickly to the new learning environment while navigating pre-existing problems within the classroom, such as having to multitask listening and note-taking, knowledge gaps, and relevancy. noteAI conquers these pre-existing and exacerbated challenges by enhancing the online learning environment to help students achieve their personal best.

## Main features 

Convert professor's speech to text using context assisted audio transcription 

As the professor is teaching whats happening is that we are looking for keywords such as nouns and key technical terms the professor mentions using machine learning. 

These keywords will then be used to perform a search through Wikipedia (web scrape and collect links) 

Create a network of potentially related topics; makes it easier for student to look at certain topics that they aren't familiar with. 

The software will use computer vision, look for things diagrams, equations and some bold ideas and then it will put a timestamp of where it was taken and the picture of the formula  

The program will then create an html page where all the links and notes (diagrams/equations) are displayed.

## How it works
